In a typical game of Werewolf, villagers try to identify the werewolves amongst them and vote them out, while werewolves attempt to eliminate as many villagers as possible to win.
It is a game of incomplete information in that no user knows the role of any other user. How do we maintain privacy on a public chain? zKPs + Homomorphic encryption!
An admin creates games, assigns roles, and manages game state. Players have thei roles encrypted and stored on chain (only accessible to them).
If I don't know anyone's roles, how do I know the move they're making is valid?
The players must create a move commitment (zkp) that proves that the action they have taken is valid
